# Tech test

## Overview

Given the dataset [here](./data/gutenberg-paragraphs.json), we would like you to create a model which can identify which paragraphs have been written by Jane Austen.

You should fork this repo and provide us with a link to it. This should contain:

- All of your code
- Any outputs generated
- Any evaluation of your model
- A README detailing:
  - how to create the environment and run your code.
  - a summary of the performance of your model.
  - what you are pleased with.
  - what you would like to improve.

## Notes

- The solution to this problem should be written in Python.
- There is no one right way to do this. We are interested in the choices that you make, how you justify them, and your development process.
- We'll be looking for clean and readable code.
- Consider what kind of error handling and testing is appropriate and how your solution might be deployed to a production environment.
